## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**1. Complexity of version system**
- **Mitigation**: Start simple (semantic versioning only), iterate
- **Fallback**: Module-level versioning if function-level proves too complex

**2. Security system performance overhead**
- **Mitigation**: Compile-time checks eliminate runtime overhead where possible
- **Fallback**: Opt-in security levels (strict vs. permissive modes)

**3. MCP integration changes**
- **Mitigation**: Abstract MCP behind interface, version the integration
- **Fallback**: Support multiple MCP versions simultaneously

### Adoption Risks

**1. Learning curve for developers**
- **Mitigation**: Excellent documentation, migration tools from existing languages
- **Fallback**: Provide "simplified CORE" subset for beginners

**2. Ecosystem fragmentation**
- **Mitigation**: Strong standard library, curated module registry
- **Fallback**: Easy interop with existing languages (FFI)
